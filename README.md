  adapted for github , course work for computational physics 201 
- 4 is the most advanced, 
- all could be commented more, but i wanted a bit of a museum to look back on!

explanation

1. approximates arctan and pi using an approximation. It's very rough. 

2. is a falling-to-earth menu with options to include air resistance (as a function of density ), it doesnâ€™t include an option for orbit. 

3. approximates Fresnel diffraction 

4.  Is approximating the 2-body problem in 2d with Runge-kutta equation to the 4TH order of h, it allows you: to pick celestial bodies using classes to orbit, 
pick an option to orbit the moon and return to earth setting  RK4(-6.8e6, 0, 0, -10720, ...) in moon_and_back()
and lets you see the orbit of the current iss . , It has room for improvement and func pick your bodies isnt too useful,
I would recommend figuring out some distances and velocities that do something interesting before using .
A consevation of energy graph with v_x,v_y  on would be nice
